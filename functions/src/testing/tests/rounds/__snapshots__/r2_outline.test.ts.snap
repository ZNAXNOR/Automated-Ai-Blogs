exports[`Round 2: Outline Generation Utility Functions buildPrompt should create a valid prompt 1`] = `
"
    Given a list of trends and corresponding content ideas, generate a detailed article outline for each.

    INPUT:
    [
  {
    "trend": "AI in healthcare",
    "idea": "AI in hospitals"
  },
  {
    "trend": "Budget smartphones",
    "idea": "Top cheap phones"
  }
]

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    For each idea, create an outline with these properties:
    - "trend": The original trend.
    - "idea": The original idea.
    - "sections": An array of objects, where each object has:
      - "heading": A descriptive heading for the section (e.g., "Introduction", "The Rise of AI in Healthcare").
      - "bullets": An array of strings, with each string being a key point or question to cover in that section.
      - "estWordCount": A number representing the estimated word count for the section.

    The final output MUST be a single, clean JSON array of outline objects. Do not include any text or formatting before or after the JSON.

    Example Output:
    [
      {
        "trend": "AI in healthcare",
        "idea": "How AI is revolutionizing patient diagnostics",
        "sections": [
          {
            "heading": "Introduction",
            "bullets": [
              "Brief overview of AI's growing role in medicine.",
              "Thesis: AI-powered diagnostics are improving accuracy and speed, leading to better patient outcomes."
            ],
            "estWordCount": 150
          },
          {
            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "bullets": [
              "Summary of key benefits.",
              "Future outlook and potential challenges."
            ],
            "estWordCount": 200
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
