### üß± Workflow Logic

1. **Extract & Analyze Draft**

   * Parse main entities, keywords, and tone.
   * Identify dominant topic and subtopics using TF-IDF or AI summarization.

2. **Generate Metadata**

   * Create **SEO-optimized title** (‚â§ 60 chars) balancing curiosity and clarity.
   * Create **slug**: lowercase, hyphenated, keyword-rich.
   * Craft **SEO description** (‚â§ 155 chars) summarizing core message with target keyword.
   * Generate **semantic keyword set** ‚Äî mix of short-tail, mid-tail, and long-tail terms.

3. **Tagging & Categorization**

   * Assign topic-based tags.
   * Suggest a primary blog category or reading level based on complexity.

4. **Media Suggestions**

   * Identify if image(s) will **add strong contextual or emotional value**.
   * For each selected image:

     * Define `type` (`ai_prompt`, `meme`, or `stock_reference`).
     * For AI prompts: follow brand tone, detailed visual description, complementary color harmony, and artistic freedom leaning toward semi-realistic illustration or 19th-century art style.
     * For memes: ensure search-accurate description; for originals, explain fully with scenario context.
     * For stock references: suggest specific people, companies, or themes, including URLs where possible.

5. **Return Output Object**

   * Combine all fields into structured metadata JSON.
   * Hand off to `r5_polish` for stylistic finalization.
